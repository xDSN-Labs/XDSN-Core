## 🔐 Deflationary Mechanics

To ensure long-term sustainability and value appreciation:

- **Burn on Usage:** A small % of tokens used for premium storage access (e.g., 2%) are burned
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Token cost adjusts automatically based on real-time network load and demand thresholds
- **Buyback Programs:** Revenue from fiat subscriptions may be used to buy and burn tokens, supporting value retention

---

## 🧠 Governance Model

Token holders can actively shape the platform through:

- **Proposal Submission:** Suggest new features or integrations
- **Voting Rights:** Weighted by token stake and user reputation (e.g., staking duration, referral performance)
- **Treasury Oversight:** Approve grants, partnerships, and ecosystem funding

---

## 🌐 Blockchain & Interoperability

- **Blockchain:** Deployed on **Polygon** for scalable throughput and low transaction fees
- **Smart Contract:** Built using a **thirdweb ERC-20 contract**, audited by **Macro Audits**
- **Wallet Security:** Critical operations are protected by **multi-signature wallets**, ensuring decentralized control and enhanced security
- **EVM-Compatible:** Integrates easily with Ethereum-based wallets and dApps
- **Bridged:** Expandable to networks like Solana, Arbitrum, and others
- **Composable:** Usable in DeFi protocols for lending, staking, or liquidity provision (e.g., Aave, Curve, Balancer)
