## 2. Problem Statement

Centralized cloud storage dominates todayâ€™s market, but at significant cost:

- High fees and non-transparent pricing lock users into expensive plans
- Single points of failure increase risk of outages and data loss
- Vendor lock-in restricts flexibility and portability
- Limited privacy controls leave data exposed to breaches, surveillance, and misuse

Meanwhile, purely decentralized networks still fall short:

- Incentive models remain fragmented across platforms, limiting overall scale
- Consumer devices (smartphones, home servers) sit idle, wasting potential capacity

xDSN tackles both sides by uniting encrypted storage resources into one permissionless, tokenized mesh that aligns incentives, lowers cost, maximizes resilience, and restores data privacy through client-side encryption and shard-and-disperse architecture.
