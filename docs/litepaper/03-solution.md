## 3. Solution Overview

xDSN is built on the IPFS protocol and delivers a multi-layered, token-aligned storage mesh network. Each client-side encrypted data block is redundantly distributed across hot and cold tiers. Mobile devices, VPS nodes, and home storage nodes earn economic incentives for securing and replicating the network.

### Key Mechanics

- Incentivized Node Roles (hot & cold tiers)
- Decentralized Encryption & Sharding  
  • All data is encrypted before leaving the client and split into shards, each stored on different nodes—no single node ever holds a complete file or plaintext.
- Validator Nodes (lite & full)  
  • Stake xDSN tokens to run consensus duties, maintain the DHT, and provide uptime proofs
- Storage Nodes (lite & full)  
  • Pin encrypted shards in the hot tier or import and archive snapshots in the cold tier
- Full Storage Nodes  
  • Combine validator and storage responsibilities for premium xDSN token rewards

All participants earn xDSN tokens based on uptime, data replication, storage proofs, geographic dispersion, and adherence to encryption best practices.
