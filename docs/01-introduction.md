Version 1.0 • July 2025

Today’s cloud storage locks us into high fees, non-transparent pricing, single points of failure, and ever-expanding privacy risks. The xDSN network shatters that model by delivering global, encrypted cloud hot and cold storage at a fraction of the cost—with built-in token rewards for every node operator, whether running on a smartphone, cloud VPS, or home server.

At its core, xDSN is built on the IPFS protocol and functions as a permissionless, incentivized, encrypted block-storage mesh network. It uses audits and automated redundancy to guarantee data integrity. Node operators earn xDSN tokens for uptime, data replication, geographic dispersion, and secure storage practices, while users enjoy low-cost, highly durable hot and cold storage without vendor lock-in or privacy compromises.
